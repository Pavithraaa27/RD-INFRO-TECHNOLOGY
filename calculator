# This is a simple calculator program in Python
# It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
print("Welcome to the simple calculator!")
num1 = float(input("Please enter the first number: "))  # We use float to allow decimal numbers

# Step 2: Ask the user to choose an operation (+, -, *, /)
print("Choose an operation to perform:")
print("1. Addition (+)")
print("2. Subtraction (-)")
print("3. Multiplication (*)")
print("4. Division (/)")
operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")  # Store the operation as a string

# Step 3: Ask the user to input the second number
num2 = float(input("Please enter the second number: "))

# Step 4: Perform the operation based on the user's choice
# We will use if-else statements to check the chosen operation

# Addition
if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
    print(f"The result of {num1} + {num2} is: {result}")

# Subtraction
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
    print(f"The result of {num1} - {num2} is: {result}")

# Multiplication
elif operation == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
    print(f"The result of {num1} * {num2} is: {result}")

# Division
elif operation == "/":
    # We need to check if the second number is zero to avoid division by zero
    if num2 == 0:
        print("Error! You cannot divide by zero.")
    else:
        result = num1 / num2
        print(f"The result of {num1} / {num2} is: {result}")

# If the user entered an invalid operation
else:
    print("Invalid operation! Please enter one of the following: +, -, *, or /.")

# Step 5: End of the program
print("Thank you for using the calculator!")
